# OOP-Project-2020
Object Oriented Porgramming Project for 2020
My project was fully written in Java, I had to solve a problem for Image filtering application with matrixes.
In the process I've used java.util, javax.imageio, java.io libraries from which I was able to use excellent tools for my application such as 
Multi-Theading(ExecutorService), Maps,Future and more.
I've used six EDGE_DETECTION algorithms such as LAPLACIAN, BOX-BLUR, DIAGONAl_LINES and so on.
